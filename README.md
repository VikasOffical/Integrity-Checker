File Integrity Checker üîç

Overview

A Python-based file integrity checker that monitors changes in files by computing and comparing hash values. This tool helps ensure file integrity by detecting modifications and newly added files.

Features

‚úÖ Detects file modifications

‚úÖ Identifies new files

‚úÖ Uses SHA-256 for hashing (customizable)

‚úÖ Stores hash values in a JSON file

‚úÖ Simple and lightweight

Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/GYANMOTAYVIKASS
/File-Integrity-Checker.git
cd File-Integrity-Checker
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the script and enter the directory path to monitor:

python file_integrity_checker.py

Example Output

New file detected: /path/to/newfile.txt
WARNING: File /path/to/modifiedfile.txt has been modified!
File integrity check completed.

How It Works

The script calculates SHA-256 hashes for all files in the specified directory.

It compares the newly computed hashes with previously stored hashes.

If a file's hash changes, a warning is displayed.

If a new file is detected, it is added to the hash store.

Hash values are saved in file_hashes.json for future comparison.
